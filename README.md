Script to help Kit Reign rename his video collection into seasons and episodes from the following structure:

Series Name
    -> 'Series Name - EpisodeNum'.mkv

to the following structure:

Series Name
    -> Season X
        -> 'Series Name - SeasonNumEpisodeNum'.mkv (abc - S01E01.mkv)

Asks for user input for season length, and to confirm if the directory needs to be touched by the script.
